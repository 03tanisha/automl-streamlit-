An interactive AutoML pipeline built with Streamlit, designed to simplify the machine learning workflow.
This web application allows users to upload datasets, automatically preprocess data, train multiple models, compare their performance, and visualize results â€” all without writing a single line of code.

## Features

 CSV Upload: Upload any dataset in CSV format.
 Automated Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and splits data into train/test sets.
 Model Training: Trains multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.).
 Model Comparison: Automatically evaluates and compares models based on key performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
 Visualizations: Displays results through interactive Streamlit charts for better interpretability.
 Best Model Selection: Highlights the top-performing model.
 Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access.

 ## Tech Stack

Frontend & App Framework: Streamlit
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud

## Project Workflow

Upload your dataset (.csv).
The app performs automated preprocessing and feature encoding.
Multiple ML models are trained and evaluated.
Results and metrics are visualized interactively.
The best-performing model is displayed with its performance metrics.
